# RamSQL

## Why a non-persistent SQL engine

The idead behing RamSQL is testing. RamSQL provide :
- Full isolation between tests
- No setup (either file or databases)
- Good performance

## Why from scratch

Because it's fun and I want :
- Discover the all go standard library
- Better understand the internal states and operations of an SQL engine
